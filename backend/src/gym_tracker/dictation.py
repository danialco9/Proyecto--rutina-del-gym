"""Turns a workout written in plain Spanish into sets ready to review.

The rule-based reader below understands the shorthand people actually write at the gym
("prensa 4x10 120", "press banca 12,10,8 a 60 rpe 8"). It runs locally, so it always works and
costs nothing. ``WorkoutReader`` is the seam a language model plugs into later, for the sentences
the rules cannot reach; nothing outside this module changes when it does.
